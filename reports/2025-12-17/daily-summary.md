+Simpler and more effective rules for medical devices – Commission proposal for a targeted revision of the medical devices regulations
+On 16 December 2025, the European Commission proposed a targeted simplification of the current rules for medical devices to make them easier, faster and more effective and further promote competitiveness, innovation and a high-level of patient safety in this key sector. The proposal will simplify EU rules for medical devices, support the digitalisation of procedures, and offer a modern, adaptive framework so that companies can respond to changing market conditions and patient needs:
+Proposal for a regulation to reduce and simply rules on medical and in vitro diagnostic devices
+The adoption of the Legislative proposal was announced in a
+press release
+.
+The key elements of the revision are summarised in a
+factsheet
+, and in a
+questions and answers document
+.
+Two staff working documents support the proposal:
+SWD on targeted evaluation
+SWD on cost savings analysis
+The proposal has been submitted to the
+European Parliament
+and the
+Council
+. To become binding Union law, the co-legislators need to adopt the text by ordinary legislative procedure. An overview of this procedure is available in the
+European Parliament
+website. You can follow the development of the legislative decision-making process on the
+"Legislative Observatory" of the European Parliament
+.
 Medical Devices regulations
 The EU revised the laws governing medical devices and in vitro diagnostics to align with the developments of the sector over the last 20 years. The priority was to ensure a robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory framework and maintain a high level of safety, while supporting innovation.
 Two new regulations on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices entered into force in May 2017.
